# Dotfiles
This is just a mirror for my dotfiles(*nix configurations).
Feel free to use and adapt them to suit your needs.
No warranties that they won't blow your computer!

Please note that I use some scripts contributed by other users, while some of them have their authors and licence in their headers, some don't.
Im confident that all of them allow sharing, and they're mostly licensed GPL, but take that into consideration in case you want anything other than personal usage.
